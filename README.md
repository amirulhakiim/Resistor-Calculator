# Resistor-Calculator
This code is a dynamic-built website that takes in inputs from user to calculate the total resistor of a set of values.

Users can chose either for parallel or series circuit. The system asks for the number of resistors, and instantly provides blank boxes based on the number of resistors submitted by user.
